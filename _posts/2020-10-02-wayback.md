Once upon a time I worked in the [Extramural program office](https://www.genome.gov/research-funding) of the National Human Genome Resource Institute (NHGRI). It was my first "big-girl" job out of college and I have the pantsuit to prove it. I mostly worked with the Program Officers in genomic medicine and ethical/legal/social issues but I had a bit of time to spare. They let me blog!

I wrote about how the pioneers of _C. elegans_ genome sequencing laid the groundwork for open data sharing principles that are now widely adopted in genetics research:
[Worm genome sequencing influenced Human Genome Project's data sharing principles](https://www.genome.gov/27552817/worm-genome-sequencing-influenced-human-genome-projects-data-sharing-principles)

And about the microbiome:
[ Close encounters of the microbial kind](https://www.genome.gov/27554517/close-enounters-of-the-microbial-kind)

I assure you that your federal tax dollars were very well spent.
