I'm currently a 5th year PhD student in [Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB)](https://bcb.unc.edu/) at the [University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (UNC-CH)](https://bbsp.unc.edu/). My work is in [statistical genetics](http://valdarlab.unc.edu/), and I build Bayesian hierarchical models to understand the relationship between genetics and complex traits in diverse mouse populations.

This space serves as a launchpad for my [CV](https://kathiesun.github.io/files/resume_2019_ksun.pdf) as well as a scratchpad to document some side projects, my attempts to learn statistics & quantitative genetics, and notes on a few things I've learned along the way. 

 	

## News
* [11/14/2020] My first first-author manuscript is now on bioRxiv! https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.13.380535v1
  * Title: Skewed X inactivation in genetically diverse mice is associated with recurrent copy number changes at the Xce locus
  * We find a novel functional allele that affects X chromosome inactivation skewing in mice
  * This new allele is the weakest in the allelic series and associated with a specific mouse strain
  * We find evidence that the weakness of this allele has to do with copy number variations in the region
