I'm currently a 5th year PhD student in [Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB)](https://bcb.unc.edu/) at the [University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (UNC-CH)](https://bbsp.unc.edu/). My work is in [statistical genetics](http://valdarlab.unc.edu/), and I build Bayesian hierarchical models to understand the relationship between genetics and complex traits in diverse mouse populations.

This space serves as a launchpad for my [CV](https://kathiesun.github.io/files/resume_2019_ksun.pdf) as well as a scratchpad to document some side projects, my attempts to learn statistics & quantitative genetics, and notes on a few things I've learned along the way.
