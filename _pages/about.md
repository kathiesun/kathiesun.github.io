I'm currently a 5th year PhD student in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB) at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (UNC-CH). My work is in statistical genetics, and I build Bayesian hierarchical models to understand the relationship between genetics and complex traits in diverse mouse populations.

#I wouldn't quite call myself a geneticist, or a statistician. My background is in environmental science and toxicology. I'm a dabbler! I'm working on it.

This space serves as a launchpad for my resume/CV as well as a scratchpad to document my mistakes, attempts to learn stats/math things, dead side projects, etc. Maybe those two efforts shouldn't share the same space. Oh well.
