I'm currently a 5th year PhD student in [Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB)](https://bcb.unc.edu/) at the [University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (UNC-CH)](https://bbsp.unc.edu/). My work is in [statistical genetics](http://valdarlab.unc.edu/), and I build Bayesian hierarchical models to understand the relationship between genetics and complex traits in diverse mouse populations.

This space serves as a launchpad for my [CV](https://kathiesun.github.io/files/resume_latest.pdf) as well as a scratchpad to document some side projects, my attempts to learn statistics & quantitative genetics, and notes on a few things I've learned along the way. 


## News
* <span style="color:blue">[**2/19/2020**]</span> My first first-author manuscript has been accepted to _Genetics_!
  * _Title_: "Bayesian modeling of skewed X inactivation in genetically diverse mice identifies a novel _Xce_ allele associated with copy number changes"
  * It is available for the time being on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.13.380535v2)
  * We find a novel functional allele that affects X chromosome inactivation skewing in mice
  * This new allele is the weakest in a known allelic series and is found in a specific mouse strain, NOD/ShiLtJ
  * We find evidence that the weakness of this allele may be related to copy number variation in the region
