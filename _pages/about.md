I'm currently a 5th year PhD student in [Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB)](https://bcb.unc.edu/) at the [University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (UNC-CH)](https://bbsp.unc.edu/). My work is in [statistical genetics](http://valdarlab.unc.edu/), and I build Bayesian hierarchical models to understand the relationship between genetics and complex traits in diverse mouse populations.

This space serves as a launchpad for my resume/CV as well as a scratchpad to document my mistakes, attempts to learn stats/math things, dead side projects, etc. Think of it as a compendium of my greatest hits plus all of the spectacular misses.
