I'm a computational biologist interested in identifying and characterizing disease-relevant genetic variation in humans and model organisms. I recently completed my PhD in [Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB)](https://bcb.unc.edu/) at the [University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (UNC-CH)](https://bbsp.unc.edu/). My PhD work was in [statistical genetics](http://valdarlab.unc.edu/), and I built Bayesian hierarchical models to understand the relationship between genetics, environmental factors, and complex traits in diverse mouse populations. Previously, I worked on estimating gene expression signatures associated with urine and blood biomarker levels in occupationally-exposed automobile spray painters. 

This space serves as a launchpad for my [CV](https://kathiesun.github.io/files/resume_latest.pdf) as well as a scratchpad to document some side projects, my attempts to learn statistics & quantitative genetics, and notes on a few things I've learned along the way. 


## News
* <span style="color:blue">[**4/16/2021**]</span> Officially got my PhD degree conferred yesterday! 
  * School's out for summer, school's out forever (for real this time)
  * And I finished my first week as an Associate Scientist at the Regeneron Genetics Center 
 
* <span style="color:blue">[**3/24/2021**]</span> I've successfully defended my PhD dissertation today
  * _Thesis title_: "Statistical Modeling of Parent-of-origin Effects and Allelic Imbalance in Genetically-diverse, Reciprocal Mouse Crosses"
  * Thanks to my committee, advisor, labmates, and fellow graduate student friends for the helpful advice and lessons along this journey!
  * Further thanks to all of my friends and family for the support over the last few years <3

* <span style="color:blue">[**2/19/2021**]</span> My first first-author manuscript has been accepted to [_Genetics_](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/genetics/iyab034/6162162?redirectedFrom=fulltext)
  * _Title_: "Bayesian modeling of skewed X inactivation in genetically diverse mice identifies a novel _Xce_ allele associated with copy number changes"
  * We find a novel functional allele that affects X chromosome inactivation skewing in mice
  * This new allele is the weakest in a known allelic series and is found in a specific mouse strain, NOD/ShiLtJ
  * We find evidence that the weakness of this allele may be related to copy number variation in the region
 
 <!--- * It is available for the time being on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.13.380535v2) --->
