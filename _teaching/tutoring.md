I've tutored math and science at the middle-school to college-level since 2014. Math classes that I'm comfortable tutoring include CC Math 1-3, Pre-algebra, Algebra, AP Calculus AB/BC, and AP Statistics, or their equivalents. I've also tutored AP Environmental Science and AP Biology.

I have also provided in-depth assistance to students preparing for standardized tests, namely, the SAT and ACT. I mostly work on the math and science sections of these tests and help with everything from concept review to testing strategies, and guiding students through practice problems/tests.

Aside from private tutoring, I've volunteered with groups and at schools around the Chapel Hill, NC area to provide help with math and standardized test prep for communities lacking resources to pay for tutors.
